Command service
===============


Features Summary
-------------
- Handles incoming commands.
- Decodes commands contained in CSP packets.
- Definitions to create the command table.
- Executes command routines defined in the command table.
- Enqueue commands for event detection. (Still not implemented)


Module Description
-----------------
The Command Service is in charge of providing the ground segment with the
ability of controlling the spacecraft at any time. This module is able to
accept and commands coming from the ground in real-time.

Commands arrive encoded inside packages from the Network layer, therefore this
module is also capable of decoding an interpreting the content of a command
package.

Normally, ground segment expects a result for each command sent to the
spacecraft, therefore this service is capable of capturing the result from any
command routine and sending it back to the ground.

Depending on the mission requirements, storing commands is also necessary, this
provides the ability to execute commands, even during the section of the orbit
without a communication link with the ground. For this, the command packages
should also specify when to execute the command routine, this can be specified
with an eventual condition, for example, when the time reaches a certain value,
or when the GPS coordinates are between a certain range, or even when the
battery charge drops under a certain threshold. For simplicity, this framework
treats time-based conditions as other event condition, taking the time stamp as
the trigger parameter. See trigger_type_t.

The specific action performed by a command will be called command routine. The
amount of command routines needed and the actions performed by each command
routine are specify of the mission and shall be implemented by the user. This
is done by creating a command table with the cmd_handle_t type, and command
routines with the DEFINE_CMD_ROUTINE definition.


Command Format
--------------
The following table represents the format of the encoded command within an CSP
packet.

| Cmd Code      | Trigger Type  | Argument List (Comma Separated)  |
| ------------- | ------------- | -------------------------------- |
| 0			        | 1				      | 3 to 	CONF_CSP_BUFF_SIZE		     |

1. Cmd code:
is the specific code that identifies a command, the code
and the corresponding command routine should be specified in the command
table (see cmd_table_t type).

2. Trigger Type:
specifies when to execute the command, see trigger_type_t.
If Trigger Type is ON_REAL_TIME, the command will be executed immediately.
Otherwise will be enqueued until the trigger condition occurs.
If Trigger Type is different to ON_REAL_TIME, an on-board parameter name and a
value should be specified to trigger the event. In this case, the first
Argument from the Argument List is expected to be the on-board parameter name,
and the following Argument the value to compare the on-board parameter with. If
Trigger Type is ON_IN_BETWEEN, then an additional Argument should be specified.
The remaining Arguments on Arguments List will be passed to the specific
command execution.

3. Argument List:
command routines may require input arguments, for example changing the
satellite's pointing direction requires as arguments the new direction.
The Argument List contains the arguments for the execution of the command
routine. Arguments are contained in a string, each value speared by comma.
See get_next_arg() and  rewind_arg_list() to retrieve arguments contained in a
cmd_packet.


Command Table
-------------
The Service needs a way to know which action to execute, when arrives a
command. For this the user needs to create a Command Table with the typedef
cmd_table_t. The table contains the corresponding code for a command, a
trigger_type_t flag that indicate when to execute the command, and a pointer
to the corresponding routine which should attend the command, this routine
has to be defined with DEFINE_CMD_ROUTINE().

@b Example:

First define the routines that should attend the commands with
DEFINE_CMD_ROUTINE().
@code
DEFINE_CMD_ROUTINE(dummy)
{
	// Here the code you want the command to perform
	return CMD_OK;
}
@endcode

Then create the table with cmd_table_t and add the corresponding command
code and the pointer to the routine.
@code
cmd_table_t mission_cmd_table = {
	//Code of command	Amount of args			Pointer to routine
	{.cmd_code = 1,		.cmd_args_num = 0,		.cmd_routine_p = &dummy},
};
@endcode


Then register the table during initialization, in init_services() function
at init_functions.c.
@code
set_cmd_table(&mission_cmd_table, sizeof( mission_cmd_table)/sizeof(*mission_cmd_table));
@endcode



Handling Commands
-----------------
Once with the table and the routines ready. Incoming commands can be
executed usin the function command_handler(). This is the key function from
the Command Service. When a packet arrives with a command call this function
to handle it. This decodes the command from the CSP packet, look-up the
Command Table to find the corresponding routine to execute the activity.
If command is ON_REALTIME executes the command immediately , otherwise enqueue
the command for eventual execution.

The Application task should be in charged of checking for new packages with
commands, and when one arrives, to call command_handler().


Command Routines
----------------
As stated before command routines are defined by user with the macro
DEFINE_CMD_ROUTINE(), and are executed when a command with the correspondign
code arrives. Inside this functions the user is allowed to write the desired
code to attend the command. For example if the command is take a picture,
the routine code should communicate with a camera to take a picture.

Note that the command routines receive two arguments: the CSP connection,
and the CSP packet. With the connection the routine is able to send messages
back to ground, using the CSP API. And with the CSP packet, the routine is able
to retrieve the incoming arguments for performing the required action.
For example, if the command is to set a parameter, the packet will contain two
arguments: the name of the parameter and the value to set to the parameter.
This arguments can be retrieved with get_next_arg().
